Objectives & Scope  
The objective of Spotify Music Explorer is to enhance how Spotify users discover, organize, and interact with music by providing tools that allow better control, better organisation, better exploration and overall just a better experience during their musical journey.  
Specifically, the objectives are to:  
Empower users with advanced playlist management through tagging, filtering, and custom categorization tools.

Bridge personal and community engagement by introducing rating systems (private and public) that foster both individual reflection and global contribution.

Enhance music discovery through a new recommendation engine combining content similarity and community insights, without being affected by listening time.

Provide full privacy control so users can decide how much of their musical activity is public or private.

Create an interactive community ecosystem where users can explore trending tracks, share recommendations through ratings and comments, and connect through collective musical interests.

Offer real-time responsiveness by ensuring updates to ratings, playlists, and recommendations happen instantly for all users.

Streamline music access and sharing via direct Spotify link generation and integration with official Spotify APIs.
